# SEAN
SEAN (A Simulation Environment for Agent-based Neuro-evolution) is a Python package for building and simulating
artificial intelligence in multi agent-based models.

# Installation.
''
pip install sean
''

# Thank you for your patience
This project is under development, I will soon be adding proper documentation and other usage details. 

# Scratch Story.
Everything starts with nothingness. The first thing to be created is the world. The world by its name has no meaning, It
still is nothingness. something arives as the first rule for the world is set. Its shape[Rows x Columns].But what good
is the shape if it stillhas nothing which is where things start to exist in the world. There are many ways to catagorise
the world. here i go with the following structure the world is made of different layers each layer serves a "class" of
purpose. E.g. One layer holds the agent , another holds food, etc... The only purpose of the world is to hold the
classes of things and five it existance. hence it need not provide the tools for visualisation or calculations. In order
to prevent confusions, each cell of a layer can hold only one element. E.g. If ther exist a scanario where say 2 agents
can occupy a single position, then each agent is to be given a separate layer.

Now, even before the creation of "thing" or "Agents" which have their own rules and can interact, there must exist 2
more things. Since we(Creators) are playing "GOD", we need a (Gods Perspecitve) method of viusualising the world we
created. (Unfotunately in this version of the universe we do not have the ability to reverse time or alter the world
once it is set in motion. these are functionalities not too complex to add to the system in other Universes(Versions).
even these functionalities are accessible through the gods perspective.) Once we can see what the world looks like, the
next thing that needs to exist is a universal clock. One which none of the Universes beings/entities have the ability to
control. This clock marches forward one step at a time. the unit of time is irrelavent and can be chosen to please the
visualisation and necessities. Thus we have time evolution.

The collection of the clock, the world and the Gods perspective is together called "The Environment"
